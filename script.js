                { title: 'My Interest In Audio', content: '<p>From as far back as I can remember I have been surrounded by a wide variety of music thanks to my parents, from Rock to Hip-hop to Electronic there was always music playing. As I have grown older, I have fallen in love with music even more and broadened what I listen to further. When I began my first job as a paperboy I began spending my money on records, both old and new, some of them being the genres from my childhood and others being new to me. I came to love music from many different countries, genres and decades. Music surrounded me for so long that I decided I wanted to try and create some. In the past few years, I have been teaching myself music production using FL Studio and it has become my favorite hobby, a large portion of spare time I have now is spent messing around in my DAW. I enjoy creating all sorts of music based on what I listened to growing up and what I listen to now. Sometimes this can mean creating my own melodies from scratch and other times I will hear an amazing part of an old song that is perfect for sampling. I have fun with both the production and mixing sides, spending time to try and learn how to improve both skills. After spending time creating music on the computer, I decided I wanted to try some hardware synths to try and create music the old-school way ending up with a re-creation of the Roland 909 and Roland TB-303. Creating music with analogue synths was just as fun as using the computer, but it offered an entirely different experience. I then decided I wanted to try and create Hip-hop using the same tech as some of my idols, RZA, J Dilla, DJ Premier, the list goes on, so I acquired a couple of old hardware samplers, the Akai MPC 1000 and the BOSS SP-303, to pair with my turntable to sample old records. Since starting this course I have also started getting into outboard gear and synths, recently upgrading my setup using skills learned on this course. In the past year I have gotten a Roland Juno 6, a Yamaha DX7, a Roland SH-101, a Moog Grandmother, a Yamaha SPX90 and a Alesis 3630. As well as buying all of this I also repair it, such as snapped switches, broken connectors and dead capacitors. Here is what my bedroom studio looks like now:</p><img src="images/Finished Setup.png" width="350px">'},

I am always watching videos from professionals in the industry on places like Mix with the Masters, Tape Notes and Andrew Masters. I like to learn mostly about mixing techniques to find new things to try and I like to see what current trends are in music production. Andrew Masters is an amazing youtube channel that I have seen tours of at least 20 studios which has given me a great idea of how a real studio runs.</p>'},

The only issue we ran into was headphone issues, but it would not be an Eastlake 1 session without headphone issues.</p><p>Since it was only 1 guitarist they could not do the song they wanted to as both have their own parts so they picked another original song called. The first thing we did was get the vocalist to test out 3 microphones as she had never used a proper one before. After singing into a Rode valve mic, an Aston Spirit and an AKG C414 it was very obvious that the Aston Spirit was the perfect mic for her voice.</p><img src="images/Vocal Mics.png" width="350px"><p>After this we moved the Aston Spirit into a vocal booth for isolation while the musicians had a break.</p><img src="images/Booth.png" width="350px"><p>Once they came back they got a take that we were all very happy with on the 2nd attempt. I then explained to them that overdubbing extras would help fill out the song and make it sound better. After 3 overdub recordings we were all very happy with how everything sounded. The guitar microphone was just a single RB100 pointed at the sound hole, but it sounded amazing.</p><img src="images/RB100.png" width="350px"><p>After finishing the first song we still had plenty of time left so they decided to do another original song, however, between takes they started doing a cover of Good Luk Babe by Chappell Roan and it sounded amazing so we decided to pivot and record that instead. For this song we wanted to try stereo recording the guitar with an AKG C414 and a Lewitt SDC.</p><img src="images/Stereo.png" width="350px"><p>I figured since he RB100 was there we should leave it and record it too just to see and it ended up adding so much extra to the guitar sound.</p><p>Here is a comparison of without the RB100:</p><audio controls><source src="audio/No RB100.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio><p>And with the RB100:</p><audio controls><source src="audio/RB100.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio><p>After that it was just adding overdubs and extra parts of guitar.</p>'},

For the vocal I used a de-esser, followed by a API channel compressor just catching the big peaks followed by a 1176 to compress the vocal. For the background vocals I did not compress them at all as I wanted them to be as natural as they could. The only effect on the vocal is a Little Plate from Soundtoys.</p><img src="images/Mix 1.png" width="350px"><p>Here is a final master of it:</p><audio controls><source src="audio/Dont Say Goodbye.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio><p>Approaching the 2nd song, I decided to mix each of the 3 guitar mics for each take down to a bus and compress each bus with a LA-2A.
